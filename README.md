# myspotify
This is a Spotify-inspired music web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 It mimics the core user experience of Spotify with custom-designed song cards, a dynamic playbar, and an interactive song panel that displays song details and cover art in real time.

Users can:

Browse and interact with multiple custom playlists

Play/pause songs with a responsive UI

View song titles, artists, and cover images in a sleek right-side panel

The design is responsive and user-friendly, with a modern layout that brings music to life visually as well as audibly.
